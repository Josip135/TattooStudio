This web app for tattoo studio is created as a part of final paper for my college. 
Design and everything you see on this application is done by me (I didn't use structures of existing web pages).
For this app I used Postgres SQL database, AWS (S3 bucket), Node.js, Express.js and React.js.
I am planning to update this project in future.
